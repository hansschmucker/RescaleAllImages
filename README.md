# RescaleAllImages

RescaleAllImages is a simple little image compressor meant for office environments where simplicity is more important than quality.

It allows you to keep the original files, processing subdirectories, specify the desired size and quality and... well that's about it. You can preview your settings, then apply it to the whole folder.
